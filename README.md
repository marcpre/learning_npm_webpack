# learning_npm_webpack

> webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset. [Github - Webpack Documentation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)

## Install

`npm install webpack webpack-dev-server --save-dev`


## How it works

1. Entry Point: Webpack has at least 1 entry point e.g. `app.js`
2. Loaders: Loaders are used to do file type dependent transformation
3. Pluging: Webpack has global plugins e.g. `uglify`
4. Output: Concatenates the output correctly.
